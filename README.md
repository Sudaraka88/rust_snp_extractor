# rust_extractSNPs

This is a draft Rust implementation of a SNP extractor.

The input is a multi-sequence fasta aligned to a single reference (like those generated by Snippy).
You can filter SNPs based on minor allele frequency. To install, clone the repo and run ```cargo build```.

## Examples
```rust
./target/debug/rust_extractSNPs -h
./target/debug/rust_extractSNPs -i tests/test.fa -o tests/op --maf 0.01
```
